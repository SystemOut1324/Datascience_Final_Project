0,1,5,1,"sometimes the power of christmas will make you do wild and wonderful things you do not need to believe in the holy trinity to believe in the positive power of doing good for others the simple act of giving without receiving is lost on many of us these days as worries about money and success hold us back from giving to others who are in need one congregation in ohio was moved to action by the power of a sermon given at their church on christmas eve the pastor at grand lake united methodist church in celina ohio gave an emotional sermon about the importance of understanding the message of jesus  for many religious people the message of jesus is to help others before yourself to make sure the people who are suffering get the help they need to enjoy life a little bit the sermon was really about generosity and what that can look like in our lives jesus lived a long time ago and he acted generously in the fashion of his time  but what would a generous act look like in our times that was the focus of the sermon  the potency of the sermon was not lost on the congregation who were so moved they had to take action after the sermon ended the congregation decided to take an offering a bowl was passed around the room and everyone pitched in what they could on this christmas eve with the words of the sermon still ringing in their ears  what did they do with this offering members of the congregation drove down to the local waffle house to visit the ladies working the night shift what a great choice on this most holy of days when everyone should be with their families  the ladies working at waffle house clearly were not with their families they had no choice but to work on this holy day because it paid the bills the congregation understood the sacrifice being made by these ladies and wanted to help them out they donated the entire offering to be split amongst the ladies at waffle house  in total that amounted to  NUM  being split amongst the staff what a beautiful moment what a perfect example of what the preacher was talking about in his sermon doing a good deed like this on christmas really helped ease the burden felt by the ladies working at waffle house sure they could not see their families but at least they got a little gift from the good people of their community  perhaps the best part about this whole event was that the congregation did not ask anything in return it was a simple act of generosity from people who understood the pain being felt by another group and sought to alleviate some of that pain it speaks volumes about the merits of the church in our daily lives this simple act brought the entire community together because it showed empathy and compassion on the most special day of the year"

3,4,8,16,"when a rare shark was caught scientists were left blundering for answers this shark has a unique feature and its not that it can survive at extreme depths or live for an extended period of time this sharks unique trait is that it can extend its jaw in a telescoping fashion beyond its mouth if youve ever seen the hit science fiction movie alien this shark is that monster made manifest on earth this shark stalks its prey and then lashes out with its telescoping teeth to snatch large fish and swallow them in one bite its a deadly predator of the deep sea  besides its telescoping teeth this shark can glow in the dark and was only recently discovered back in  NUM  in the three decades since it was first found just a select few of this exotic shark species have been found  but during a routine survey in the donghe township in taiwan the countrys fisheries research institute found five of these horrifying deepsea sharks  the team was notably horrified and described the most obvious feature are the needleshaped teeth like snakelike fangs this is also the origin of viper shark name  thats right this beast is called the viper shark and as you can tell by its name it is ferocious with its prey  although researchers have gotten their hands on a few of these animals little is known about them but researchers think these creatures swim between  NUM  NUM  meters under the surface of the ocean during the day to  NUM  meters below at night could this be because of temperature changes or is it something to do with light  the last five specimens were trawled up from a depth of  NUM  meters below the surface of the sea four were already dead but a living specimen was immediately immersed in cool seawater but it could not handle the sudden change in its habitat it perished just a day later  while viper sharks look like the alien monster from the movie they do not feed on humans their main food sources are crustaceans and bony fishes one of their favorite lunch items is the lanternfish these creatures might be attracted toward the shark because of their glowinthedark bodies and when they swim close enough the shark lashes out with its extendable jaw and snatches the fish up and devours it whole  the first specimens of viper shark were found off the coast of shikoku island in japan in  NUM  bottomtrawler vessel seiryomaru was the first to haul these creatures up to the surface of the sea  because the fish was a new discovery at the time its scientific name honors the seiryomaru captain hiromichi kabeya the sharks scientific name was trigonognathus kabeyai  although not much about these fish are known scientists classify them in as a dogfish shark they have only been found in the deep parts of the pacific ocean  how would you react if this shark came up on the other end of your fishing line would you think you were having a nightmare"
